# AI and Games
> An app for demonstrating the use of AI (Reinforcement Learning) with pixel games.

The live demo can be found [here](https://rl-games-ai.netlify.app). Slides [here](https://slides.com/liadyosef/rl-games-ai/fullscreen).<br/><br/>

## Background
This repo contains the code for the demos in this talk: [Games are smarted than us](https://slides.com/liadyosef/rl-games-ai/fullscreen), which was given in [React Summit 2020](https://reactsummit.com/).

The concepts and tools that are used in this repo come from the world of pixel games building and reinforcement learning, especially:

1. [Bitmelo](https://bitmelo.com/) - A tool for easily building pixel games
2. [ReinforceJS](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs) - A JS library by Andrej Karpathy that allows to easily train RL models in the client

## Further reading
Reinforcement Learning is a fascinating field. For starting, I recommend these talks from David Silver: [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&ab_channel=DeepMind)

## Developing
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
